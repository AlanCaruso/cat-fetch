# Cat Fetch

Cat Fetch is a GitHub repository that showcases a React image gallery app that fetches cat images from a remote API endpoint. This project serves as a practical demonstration of using the Fetch API, as well as the useState and useEffect hooks in React. It also provides a basic configuration for initializing a JavaScript project using Vite and installing React.

## Features

- Utilizes the Fetch API to fetch cat images from a remote API endpoint.
- Retrieves random cat facts using the Cat Fact Ninja API.
- Renders the fetched text onto cat images obtained from the Cataas API.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cat-fetch.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd cat-fetch
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```shell
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the app.

## Technologies Used

- Vite: A fast and opinionated web build tool that sets up the initial JavaScript project configuration.
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Fetch API: A modern web API for making asynchronous HTTP requests.
- useState and useEffect Hooks: Key React hooks used for managing state and handling side effects.

Feel free to explore the codebase to understand how the Fetch API, useState, and useEffect hooks are used to handle data fetching and rendering within a React application.
